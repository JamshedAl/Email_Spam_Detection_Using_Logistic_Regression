# Email_Spam_Detection_Using_Logistic_Regression
Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm that can effectively classify emails as spam or non-spam based on various features. By training a logistic regression model on a labeled dataset, we can achieve accurate spam detection, enhancing email security. 
Logistic regression is a statistical model used to predict binary outcomes based on input variables. In the context of email spam detection, logistic regression can be trained to classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate. The algorithm learns from a labeled dataset consisting of a collection of emails labeled as spam or non-spam (ham).
Feature Extraction:
Before applying logistic regression, the email content needs to be converted into a numerical representation. This process involves extracting relevant features from the email, such as the presence of certain keywords, the frequency of specific words or phrases, and other linguistic characteristics. These features serve as inputs to the logistic regression model.
